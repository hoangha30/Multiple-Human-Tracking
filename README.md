# Multiple-Human-Tracking
In this project
- Research and compare various object detection models and tracking algorithms.
- Utilize the YOLOv8n model and Bytetrack algorithm to detect and track multiple objects (humans).
- Train, test and evaluate on MOT17 dataset.
- Fine-tune the best Bytetrack hyper-parameters on the MOT17 dataset.
- Demo with video shot in the university auditorium.
